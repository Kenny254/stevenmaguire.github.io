In my current role as VP of Technology at [Earth Class Mail](https://www.earthclassmail.com/refer/v2cy2x) I handle a healthy mix of leadership, "big picture" scenarios and code contributions on non-critical path support projects. Every so often those coding projects result in the birth of a new open source project that offers big value from a small manageable code footprint; [recently I wrote about one of those projects](https://www.earthclassmail.com/blog/chargify-app-for-zendesk-open-source).

The bulk of my current open source contributions have been framework agnostic composer packages written in PHP. The composition of what I consider to be a high quality composer package consists of autoated tests covering at least 80% of the code, continuous integration support, semantic versioning, and explicit configuration for installation via a package manager.

Writing and open sourcing the [Chargify App for Zendesk](https://github.com/delivered/chargify-zendesk) was a new experience all together and I am exicted to learn more about the process of building and maintaining high quality Zendesk Apps.

In the [Open Source Experiment: Chargify App for Zendesk post](https://www.earthclassmail.com/blog/chargify-app-for-zendesk-open-source) I provide some insight into the problem we were solving with the project, likely leaving some to be desired in
