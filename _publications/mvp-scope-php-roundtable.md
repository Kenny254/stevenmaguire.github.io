name: "From Idea To Production: Part 1"
audience: "PHP Roundtable"
description: "We discuss an idea for a web app and identify ways to turn it into a real-life product on the web. We start with describing the domain and the problems the app should solve. Then we identify the personas that will interact with the app. We discuss the features features the app should have to fix the problems and we sort all the features by priority. Finally we talk about timeline, deliverables and next steps. The app we discuss will be launched to production by the next airing of this multi-part series of taking an idea to code."
