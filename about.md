Hello - I'm [Steven Maguire](http://twitter.com/StevenMaguire). I've been building software [since 2004](http://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenmaguire).

As of February 2015, I have been lending a helping hand to a few early and growth stage startups in Chicago; improving product development processes, recruiting and building product teams, and adding technical vision to strategic conversations.

In the remaining time I am actively involved in the [Chicago tech meetup community](http://www.meetup.com/members/40042402/), contributing to [open source projects](https://github.com/stevenmaguire), [authoring online training material](http://www.pluralsight.com/author/steven-maguire), [talking about product development](https://www.phproundtable.com/episode/part-1-turning-an-idea-into-code-for-production), and volunteering for The [All-Stars Project, Development School for Youth](http://allstars.org/dsy/) as a Program Associate.

In the previous chapter of my life, I was using my powers for good [redefining the textbook industry for both students and publishers](http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/how-i-am-using-technology-disrupt-education-industry) at [Packback](http://www.packbackbooks.com/) as the Head of Engineering. I've left them in [good hands](http://www.karllhughes.com/2015/packback-engineering/).

Prior to joining the Packback team I helped transition the [recently acquired TrainSignal](http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/it-educator-trainsignal-acquired-pluralsight-eight-figure-deal) into the trusting hands of [Pluralsight](http://pluralsight.com). At TrainSignal I served four years as the technology team leader, product owner, and an engineer where I contributed a [fair amount](http://github.com/stevenmaguire) of C#, JavaScript & PHP code. I also flexed my UX muscles to design and build a game changing subscription based online learning platform for IT professionals.

While attending [East Carolina University](http://www.ecu.edu/), I designed and developed a [lot of small projects](http://stevenmaguire.com/portfolio) and created a [blog that focused on people named "Steven"](http://www.axisofstevil.com/) with my good friends [Graham](http://twitter.com/chiatar) and [Rich](http://twitter.com/BreakfastDuck).

In 2008 I produced a [short film](http://vimeo.com/802365) and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Digital Media Production.

In 2009 I became a [Certified Usability Analyst](http://www.humanfactors.com/certification/CUA.asp). Then in 2012, I attended the [UI17 Conference in Boston, MA](http://www.uie.com/events/uiconf/2012/) and became inspired to [improve my design process](http://www.discussingdesign.com/). I believe process is as important as deliverables.

My personal projects are typically composed of one or more of these frameworks, tools, and technologies:

- [Laravel](http://laravel.com/docs) - an open source PHP framework (move over [Code Igniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter))
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) - a popular JavaScript framework (sorry [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/))
- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) - framework to develop front-end code faster and better
- [Codeship](http://codeship.io) - powerful continuous integration and delivery
- [Envoyer](http://envoyer.io) - no downtime deployment of php applications
- [Forge](http://forge.laravel.com) - easy server configuration and management of applications tuned for php
- [Trello](http://trello.com) - a simple tool for organizing any project
- [Heroku](http://heroku.com) - cloud computing designed and built for developers.
- [Twilio](http://twilio.com) - a fun platform for adding SMS and telephony functionality to web applications
- [Pusher](http://pusher.com) - a service that provides API support to leverage HTML5 WebSockets and make web applications respond in realtime

In 2013 and 2012 I joined teams to produce films for the [48 Hour Film Festival in Chicago, IL](http://www.48hourfilm.com/). First with [Catington Station](http://catingtonstation.com/) for a [silent film](http://vimeo.com/48369036). Then with [Whiskey Muzzle](http://whiskeymuzzle.com) for [another film](http://vimeo.com/72493425).

I am also very interested in participating in, and discussing hackathons and [overnight website challenges](http://www.trainsignal.org/building-a-website-from-scratch-in-24-hours).
