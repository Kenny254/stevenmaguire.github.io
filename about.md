Hello - I'm [Steven Maguire](http://twitter.com/StevenMaguire). I've been building software [since 2004](http://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenmaguire).

As of January 2016, I have been using my powers to help physical mail delivery suck a little bit less as Vice President of Technology at [Earth Class Mail](https://www.earthclassmail.com). The product technology stack includes C#/.NET, Ruby on Rails, client-side JavaScript, and a mixture of Microsoft Azure & Amazon Web Services.

In the remaining time I am actively involved in the [Chicago tech meetup community](http://www.meetup.com/members/40042402/), contributing to [open source projects](https://github.com/stevenmaguire), [authoring online training material](http://www.pluralsight.com/author/steven-maguire), [talking about product development](https://www.phproundtable.com/episode/part-1-turning-an-idea-into-code-for-production), and volunteering for The [All-Stars Project, Development School for Youth](http://allstars.org/dsy/) as a <acronym title="Professional development coach for students 16 to 21 years old">Program Associate</acronym>. Additionally, I am interested in participating in, and discussing hackathons & overnight website challenges.

For the better part of 2015 I was lending a helping hand to a few early and growth stage startups in Chicago; improving product development processes, recruiting and building product teams, and adding technical vision to strategic conversations.

In the previous chapter of my life, I was [redefining the textbook industry for both students and publishers](http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/how-i-am-using-technology-disrupt-education-industry) at [Packback](http://www.packbackbooks.com/) as the Head of Engineering. I've left them in [good hands](http://www.karllhughes.com/2015/packback-engineering/).

Prior to joining the Packback team I helped transition [TrainSignal](http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/it-educator-trainsignal-acquired-pluralsight-eight-figure-deal) into the trusting hands of [Pluralsight](http://pluralsight.com). At TrainSignal I served four years as the technology team leader, product owner, and an engineer where I contributed a [fair amount](http://github.com/stevenmaguire) of C#, JavaScript & PHP code. I also flexed my UX and [Certified Usability Analyst](http://www.humanfactors.com/certification/CUA.asp) muscles to design & build a game changing subscription based online learning platform for IT professionals.

I joined teams to produce films for the [48 Hour Film Festival in Chicago, IL](http://www.48hourfilm.com/). First with [Catington Station](http://catingtonstation.com/) for a [silent film](http://vimeo.com/48369036) in 2012. Then with [Whiskey Muzzle](http://whiskeymuzzle.com) for [another film](http://vimeo.com/72493425) in 2013.

I produced a [short film](http://vimeo.com/802365) and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Digital Media Production from [East Carolina University](http://www.ecu.edu/) in 2008.

While attending East Carolina University, I designed and developed a [lot of small projects](/artwork/) and created a [blog that focused on people named "Steven"](http://www.axisofstevil.com/) with my good friends [Graham](http://twitter.com/chiatar) and [Rich](http://twitter.com/BreakfastDuck).

My personal projects are typically composed of one or more of these frameworks, tools, and technologies:

- [Laravel](http://laravel.com/docs) - an open source PHP framework (move over [Code Igniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter)).
- [Ruby on Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) - an open source Ruby framework.
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) - a popular JavaScript framework (sorry [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/)).
- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) & [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - frameworks to develop front-end code faster and better.
- [Codeship](http://codeship.io) - powerful continuous integration and delivery.
- [Envoyer](http://envoyer.io) - no downtime deployment of php applications.
- [Forge](http://forge.laravel.com) - easy server configuration and management of applications tuned for php.
- [Trello](http://trello.com) - a simple tool for organizing any project.
- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=196f6f6823aa) - simple cloud hosting, built for developers.
- [Twilio](http://twilio.com) - a fun platform for adding SMS and telephony functionality to web applications.
- [Pusher](http://pusher.com) - a service that provides API support to leverage HTML5 WebSockets and make web applications respond in realtime.
